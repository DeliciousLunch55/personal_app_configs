Personal configurations for various applications.

BASH CONFIGURATION:
--------------------
 1. To install bashrc scripts, run the bashSetup.sh script in the bash folder.  Do not run the setup as sudo, as this will change the user/group ownership of your .bashrc file to root:root.  This will append your current ~/.bashrc file with the bash configuration.
 2. To uninstall bashrc scripts, run the bashUninstall.sh script in the bash folder.  Do not run the uninstaller as sudo.
