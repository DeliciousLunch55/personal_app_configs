Personal configurations for various applications.

BASH CONFIGURATION:
--------------------
 1. To install bashrc scripts, run the bashSetup.sh script in the bash folder.  This will append your current ~/.bashrc file with the bash configuration.  I don't have a good uninstallation script yet, but the appended file is clearly marked, so if you want to uninstall, just delete the clearly marked areas from ~/.bashrc.
